# Garden Game
**v. 0.11**

## What's new?
**Alpha is out!**
- Currently not published anywhere. You can download the .zip package, unpack it and open index.html to play.
- Allow music in your browser for fully immersive gaming nostalgia experience.
- You can plant various kind of flowers and sell them to buy decorations: gnomes, flamingo and statues.


## Known bugs
- One type of grass tile has a slightly different tint.
- Music is played only after the player allows it in a web browser.


## TO DO:
Implement web functionalities:
- Profiles & saving.
- Chat.
- Map generator's seeds and settings.

Better GUI:
- Inventory
- Ingame shop(s).

More content:
- More terrain objects.
- More plants.
- More tools.
- Modular objects: trees, fences, rivers etc.
- Upgrades.

Good design patterns:
- Modularize js scripts.
- Refactorize "tool tables" -> more scalability is needed.

In the long run:
- "Long distance" game economy: plants need time to grow, more expensive content etc.
- Game modes (?): tower defense, avatars?
